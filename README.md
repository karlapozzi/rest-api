# A REST API Project
 My ninth Treehouse project: A REST API created using Express, Sequelize, and Node.js. This API provides a way to administer a mock school database containing information about users and courses. Users can create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in (so the API includes basic auth). 
 
I went for an exceeds expectations/extra credit grade, so my project also includes validation that user emails are valid and unique as well as more complex user and course routes. These route improvements include: filtering out certain properties, handling more errors, and adding an extra auth layer for deletion.
